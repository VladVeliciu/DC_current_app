# DC Current Learning App

Educational C++ application for learning and applying the fundamentals of **DC circuits**.  
Includes a theory module (concepts, formulas) and a practical module for building circuits and calculating parameters such as current, voltage, power, and equivalent resistances.

**Key features:**
- User & admin accounts (local file-based)
- Add/edit/remove circuits, batteries, and resistors
- Supports series & parallel configurations
- Calculates: I, U, P, W, Pmax, equivalent EMF & resistance
- Simple graphical interface (graphics.h, image-based diagrams)

🛠️ Tech: C++, file storage, WinBGI/graphics.h  
📌 Origin: high school diploma project (Atestat, 2020)
